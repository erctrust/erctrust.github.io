                            Abstract: Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.

                            Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are attracting increasing attention in the maritime industry. Despite the expected benefts in reducing human error and signifcantly increasing the overall safety level, the development of autonomous ships would undoubtedly introduce new risks. The overall goal of this work is to develop an approach to evaluate the risk level of major hazards associated with MASS. To that extent, a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method is used in conjunction with Evidential Reasoning (ER) and Rule-based Bayesian Network (RBN) to quantify the risk levels of the identifed hazards. The results show that ‘interaction with manned vessels and detection of objects’ contributes the most to the overall risk of MASS operations, followed by ‘cyber-attacks’, ‘human error’ and ‘equipment failure’. The fndings provide useful insights on the major hazards and can aid the overall safety assurance of MASS.

                            Climate change is the most threating environmental issue and the biggest challenge that humanity has ever faced. While acting as the key nodes of globalisation and international business, seaports are exposed to the vulnerability of climate impacts, mainly because of their locations, including low-lying areas, coastal zones, and deltas. The paper is to develop a Climate Change Risk Indicator (CCRI) framework for climate risk assessment of seaports, enabling research-informed policymaking on such a demanding topic. Due to the increasing number of extreme weather events (EWEs), climate change adaptation is becoming an essential and necessary issue to be addressed by seaport stakeholders. Climate risk analysis aids rational adaptation planning. Many climate assessments have been done for measuring climate vulnerabilities, and various climate adaptation measures have been proposed for reducing climate risks. However, few of them used quantitative approaches for climate risk evaluations in seaports and fewer on the provisions of CCRIs for comparing climate risks of different locations and timeframes to guide rational policy making. Furthermore, climate change is a dynamic issue, requiring big objective data to support the analysis (e.g. monthly climate data on CCRIs) of climate threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, Evidence Reasoning (ER) is employed to evaluate the climate risks in seaports by tackling the incomplete data. The findings reveal the quantitative measures of climate change risks in different locations and in different months. Furthermore, the risk levels of seaports in the future are assessed for observing the changes and informing policy making. The main contributions of this study include the visualisation of the comprehensive climate risk levels and provision of a new climate risk analysis framework through the comparison of climate change risks with respect to different locations and timeframes. Suitable climate adaptation measures can be chosen to implement, and seaports can cooperate on climate resilience issues (e.g. seaport network service and pre-disaster relief logistics).

                            Increasing human installations and vessel traffic in offshore waters render a collision risk between ships and offshore installations (SOI). Past decades have witnessed many accidents occurred in the offshore waters involving complex traffic networks. To safeguard offshore installations and improve water-bound transport safety, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian-based model to assess the SOI collision risk involving passing ships. It first identifies the relevant risk factors with the aid of a geometrical analysis concerning SOI collisions. The causal relationships between the risk factors are numerically defined by causal rules with a degree of belief structure, while a Bayesian network (BN) is constructed to aggregate the evaluated value of each risk factor and to assess the collision risks involving different navigational environments. To illustrate the new model, a real case on SOI collision risk in the Liverpool Burbo Bank offshore wind farm is investigated. The results provide empirical evidence for SOI collision risk analysis under complex water conditions and uncertain navigational environments and hence useful insights on SOI collision avoidance.

                            With the occurrence of more frequent and intense climate change events, transportation systems, including their infrastructure and operations become increasingly vulnerable. However, the existing research related to climate risks, adaptation and planning in the transport sector is still at an embryonic stage. Understanding such, this paper presents a critical review on climate risks, adaptation strategies and planning in the context of road and rail transportation systems. It aims to conduct a rigorous survey, to highlight any significant research gaps not addressed in past studies and to analyse current emerging topics to guide future directions. It critically dissects the selected papers by categorising them into several dimensions to reveal the status quo and potential challenges, including climate risk assessment, transport asset management, climate planning and policy, and adaptation of transport infrastructure to climate change. It will provide valuable references for future research and constructive insights and empirical guidance on climate adaptation, risk analysis, transport planning and other important relevant topics.

                            It is vital to analyse ship collision risk for preventing collisions and improving safety at sea. The state-of-the-art of ship collision risk analysis focuses on encountering conflict between ship pairs, subject to a strong assumption of the ships having no/little spatiotemporal motion uncertainty. This paper proposes a probabilistic conflict detection approach to estimate potential collision risk of various multi-vessel encounters, in which the spatiotemporal-dependent patterns of ship motions are newly taken into account through quantifying the trajectory uncertainty distributions using AIS data. The estimation accuracy and efficiency are assured by employing a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, which provides the quantitative bounds on the approximation accuracy and allows for a fast estimation of conflict criticality. Several real experiments are conducted using the AIS-based trajectory data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed new approach. The results show that it enables the effective detection of collision risk timely and reliably in a complicated dynamic situation. They therefore provide valuable insights on ship collision risk prediction as well as the formulation of risk mitigation measures.

                            Since the start of the current century, the world at large has experienced uncertainties as a result of climate change, terrorism threats and increasing economic upheaval. These uncertainties create non-classical risks for global seaborne container trade and liner shipping networks (LSNs). The purpose of this paper is to establish a novel risk-based resilience framework to measure the effectiveness of different recovery strategies for the disruptions in LSNs in a quantitative manner. Design/methodology/approach Based on a resilience loss triangle model, an indicator of resilience-cost ratio is designed to measure the performance of LSNs during recovery. Four recovery strategies are proposed to test the rationality and feasibility of the developed indicator in aiding decision-making of LSNs from a resilience perspective. Findings The analysis results reveal that the superiorities of different recovery strategies vary depending on both the structures of LSNs and the specific requirements during recovery. Moreover, optimizing the sequence of ports being recovered will improve the overall recovery efficiency of the investigated LSN. Research limitations/implications As an exploratory research trying to enrich the risk-based resilience evaluation of LSNs from a complex network perspective, only two attributes (e.g. port scare and economy) are considered at the current stage when estimating the time needed to fully recover the whole LSN. In future research, more attributes from the industry may be identified and incorporated into the proposed model to further extend its ability and application scopes. Practical implications The findings will help to improve managerial understandings of recovery strategies to build more resilient LSNs. The proposed model has the capability to be tailored to tackle different types of risks in addition to the storm disaster condition. Originality/value The risk-based resilience framework and the resilience-cost ratio indicator are newly developed in this research. They can consider LSNs' structural resilience and the total costs that a recovery strategy needs to restore the whole system simultaneously.

                            Port State Control (PSC) inspection aids to control substandard ships and ensure safety at sea. Current risk-based PSC research and practice fail to incorporate ship deficiency records into detention probability analysis, because of the difficulty introduced by the involved big deficiency data. In this paper, a new Bayesian Network (BN) based PSC risk probabilistic model is developed to analyze the dependency and interdependency among the risk factors influencing PSC inspections based on big data derived from the inspection database of Tokyo MoU for the period between 2014 and 2017. The results reveal that ship's safety condition related deficiencies as well as technical features of the inspected vessel itself are among the most influential factors concerning PSC inspections and ship detention. New Bayesian learning methods are used to improve the model efficiency in ship detention prediction. As a result, the newly developed model has shown a reliable performance on dynamic prediction and cause-effect diagnosis of ship detention probabilities by pioneering the incorporation of ship deficiency records in the analysis. The findings provide important insights on how to facilitate risk-based PSC inspections for both ship owners and port states. They provide support for port state authorities to implement rational inspection policies.

                            Current maritime emergency logistics studies on oil spills are largely conducted based on static analysis to optimize resource scheduling. This does not suitably address the practical industrial demand, where the oil spill risk in nature dynamically depends on the motion of oil films. To better simulate the reality, this paper aims to conduct a study on a novel dynamic multi-objective location-routing model with split delivery considering practical characteristics, such as the time-varying demands of contaminated areas, uncertainty in the state of associated transportation networks and interrelationship between the changes in spilled oil films and emergency operations, which all result from the dynamic motion of oil films at sea. To address model complexity, we propose a two-stage optimization model, whereby a hybrid heuristic algorithm is developed to obtain Pareto solutions. To demonstrate the proposed model and approaches, a case study involving a series of sensitivity analyses is presented to highlight the importance of the proposed model and determines its implications.

                            During an emergency response to a major oil spill accident, the features of the motion of the oil films affect the response decisions. A highly dynamic optimal solution is needed to tackle the continuous changes in the demand for emergency resources and transportation networks for logistics deliveries that must occur. To effectively balance the responsiveness and the total response cost in emergency operations, this paper proposes a dynamic multi-objective location-routing model to address new challenges, such as the time-varying conditions in the response to oil spills and the interrelationship between the decision-making environment and emergency operations. Since the problem is NP-hard, to efficiently obtain Pareto solutions, a novel implementation of a heuristic framework based on particle swarm optimization is developed to conduct numerical experiments. Additionally, to handle the multi-objective model, an alternative solution based on the cost performance method is adopted to help decision makers select the ideal options for Pareto solutions. A case study of a major oil spill accident that occurred in the Bohai Bay is conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed model and approaches and the real-world implications.

                            In the global effort to reduce Green House Gases and carbon emissions, there is great importance for the shipping industry to decarbonise and move forward into a greener future. However, there is a lack of academic commentary on how attempts at various decarbonisation methods reported in research articles have developed over the 21st century, particularly in line with the relevant policy and regulatory developments. This paper analyses how the shipping industry has decarbonised by utilising 294 papers from 2000 to 2020. By analysing 20 years' worth of research, this paper delivers a comprehensive review of shipping decarbonisation research and analyses the evolution of its themes as a function of time. It therefore aids to develop a greater understanding and comparison of governmental, economic and academic perspectives (and their potential alignment) for the industry to decarbonise. For 2017-20 the key shipping decarbonisation technologies were summarised and their advantages, disadvantages and current academic literature applications are revealed. Furthermore, the analysis of the evolution of shipping decarbonisation research themes reveals clear research gaps in the current literature and guides the development of a future research agenda with the prediction of future opportunities and potential for shipping decarbonisation research developments for the shipping industry.

                            In this research, the effects of the passenger population composition and ship familiarity in an emergency evacuation are analysed. The results identified that the effects of different population compositions on the Ro-Ro evacuation process vary significantly. It is therefore recommended that a targeted survey of the population on a specific ship should be conducted before the evacuation analysis to improve the analysis accuracy of the evacuation process. It is not always the case that a higher familiarity with the ship staircase layout necessarily results in less time to complete the evacuation, and the issue of balanced exits has to be considered due to its significant impact. The results obtained in this research can be used to aid the ship's staircase layout optimisation to facilitate the evacuation process. Given the type of Ro-Ro vessel in this analysis, it is suggested that adding a staircase towards the bow of the ship can reduce the evacuation time by 13.6%, when considering 95% of the passengers to complete an evacuation. Similarly, adding one staircase at the stern can reduce the time by approximately 10% for all passengers to complete the evacuation. It is not recommended that the size of staircases towards the middle of the ship should be adjusted.

                            Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS) is widely deemed as the future of global shipping. The cyber vulnerability has however been identified as an emerging problem and a potential barrier influencing MASS development. This paper, through the investigation of the fundamental trust problem with regards to the cyber security of MASS systems, aims to develop a blockchain-based scheme for the trust management of MASS. The innovative idea of using blockchain within the MASS context is that the mobile entities in the MASS operational environment constitute a decentralized opportunity network, which makes blockchain an appealing tool to provide a solution to evaluating and maximizing the trust over the dynamics of the entities. This paper elaborates the mechanism by which the MASS entities participate in keeping the main chain. Firstly, the paper illustrates how the Belief of Trust (BoT) among the entities is encoded and assembled into the chain, to allow MASS entities to have an initial judgement towards another entity before they get acquainted. Secondly, at the consensus layer of blockchain technique, it addresses how the witness, who has a temporary right of producing a block and append it to the chain, can be elected among the nodes and how to incent the nodes to maintain the blockchain from a proof-of-stake perspective. Finally, this paper describes how the MASS entities can use the certificate dependence information to evaluate the trust transition in the MASS operating environment. Typical scenarios are delineated to show the procedure of certificate inquiry, handover of controls between maritime supervision centers and shore-side remote control centers in case of the occurrence of unexpected events. The findings provide any entity in an MASS network with an effective solution to evaluating the degree of trust he can have for any targeted node/participant. They can therefore help choose better (more trustable) nodes to maintain the MASS network's knowledge of evidence to judge the trust on an unknown member.
